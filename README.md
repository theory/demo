üëãüèª Hello, I'm [theory](/theory). This is my little demo library. It's a
simple Perl module that allows one to script a terminal application and
present it by typing on the keyboard. A couple places you can see it in
action:

*   [POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI][trunk]
*   [Introduction to PGXN Architecture][pgxn]
*   [A Pattern for a Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service][pgcon23]
    (PGConn 2023)
